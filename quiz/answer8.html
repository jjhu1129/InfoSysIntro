		The minor being referred to is Global Systems Management. This area of study is for students wishing to develop skills essential for participating in emerging opportunities in global business systems, system development, product development, and global project management. Students will learn about outsourcing and cross-cultural communications from theoretical and practical viewpoints. Specific electives can be chosen to tailor to individual needs. This is only one of many minors/additional majors available at CMU that partners very well with the IS major.
